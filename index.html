                According to the World Taekwondo Federation, Taekwondo is â€œthe right way of using all parts of the body to stop fights and help to build a better and more peaceful world." It is the martial art of combining foot, fist, and discipline techniques. Taekwondo originated in Korea, being called different names during its development. It is used by the Korean military, which requires a 2 year service for all male citizens, and is one of two usual martial arts classified as an Olympic sport, the other being Judo. It was introduced as a sport in place of a demonstration at the Sydney 2000 Games. However, Karate joins Judo and Taekwondo as an Olympic sport for the upcoming Tokyo 2020 games, as they are taking place in Japan where the form was created.

                The main focus of Taekwondo is de-escalation and is meant to be used as self-defense first. Keeping calm and in sync with your body is the first step to understanding Taekwondo. It is good to occasionally practice meditation and mindfulness either before or after training, focusing on what you want to or have accomplished. Remaining calm and in control is also practiced through Poomsae, the forms of Taekwondo. While the main goal to keep in mind is de-escalation of violence and control, demonstrations of this control are shown off in sparring matches. It is important to note that sparring is not a fight, there are no rules or control in a fight, whereas the main element of sparring is control.

                    I plan on discussing three key points to be able to succeed in starting Taekwondo in 3 separate posts: wellness, the basics necessary to begin Taekwondo. Forms, introductory level forms, presented through videos. Sparring, basic sparring techniques and steps to effectively spar.
