                When beginning your training, the most important part is to make sure you have a proper warmup. This can range from person to person, but a general warmup should usually take around ten minutes. Now is a good time to reflect on what you are going to be doing during your training for the day. While warming up it is good to also warm up your mind, and make sure that you are in the right state of mind. Practicing means all of your focus should be on improving, do not be nervous about making mistakes as even when you are doing something incorrectly you still can learn from it. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class ="padded">
            <p style = "text-indent : 50px;">
                When you feel ready to move, start with basic stretches. Shake your body out and get relaxed. The point of stretching at the beginning of practice is not to test your limits, instead it is simply to make sure that every part of your body is ready to be used. Taekwondo is a full body sport, and using muscles you may have never used before can happen. Reach for your toes with your hands almost together, reach up to the sky, and then start tracing circles in front of you. 
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class ="padded">
            <p style = "text-indent : 50px;">
                It is also important to stretch out your lower body, sit down and place them as far as you can with ease. Then, alternate between reaching down to your right leg, the left, and then toward the center. Now, put your feet together and reach down to the center. You can also switch between having one leg stretched out, and the other bended, your foot around the other legâ€™s thigh. For a totally different stretch, place the leg on top instead of touching the thigh. This stretch is more focused on the calf. Next up, exercise.

                Cardio is an important part of Taekwondo, especially during sparring you need endurance to be able to give it your all and not lose your breath while doing it. An easy way to gradually build endurance is by running a few laps, if you have the space. If not, knee highs, jumping jacks, push ups, and mountain climbers are the perfect warm up. Knee highs are especially important, as the ability to raise your knees up comes in handy when kicking. For maximum effect (and sweat), alternate between running and doing an exercise. Core exercises, like sit ups, crunches, or leg raises, can be effective warmups but are also great for an after workout cooldown.

                The last part of the warm up focuses on kicking practice. Targets are not necessary when training a kick, but it can be satisfying to hear your foot hitting the target successfully. I will be discussing 3 types of kicks: a front kick, a roundhouse kick, and a side kick. Almost every kick will follow 3 basic motions. The raise, a turn, and the kick. It is also important when kicking to not simply drop your foot, but instead bring it back. However, for starters this is less important. We will look at kicking in a different post.
