                For many students, the front kick is the first kick they learn. It focuses on using the ball of your foot to kick, and is good training for understanding both the raise and snap that goes into a kick. I said most kicks follow 3 basic motions, let’s go over the motions for a front kick.

            <p style = "text-indent : 50px;">
                First, start with your dominant leg in the back, your torso should be facing toward that leg.Lift your knee up in front of your body, foot still facing towards the ground, and turn your body to face forward. Then, snap out your leg, making sure to point your toes up, hit the target or air with the ball of your foot. Snap your leg back and place it in front of your body. Practice that a few times with both legs, focusing mostly on the snap.

        <h1>Roundhouse</h1>

        <div class ="padded">
            <p style = "text-indent : 50px;">
                The roundhouse kick is possibly one of the most important kicks for anyone learning Taekwondo. It can be a fast and strong attack while also allowing you to keep your opponent at a distance.The power comes from the snap, and the twist. It all comes from turning your hips and using your whole body in the kick.

        <div class ="padded">
            <p style = "text-indent : 50px;">
                Similar to our front kick, you’ll have to lift up your knee in front of you. Now, turn your hips and your leg so that your foot is pointed toward the target. Then, snap it out and hit with the top of your foot. Make sure to hit with your foot, not your toes, because hitting with your toes would hurt you more than the target. Then quickly snap it back, and turn back to your original position. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <h1>Side</h1>

        <div class ="padded">
            <p style = "text-indent : 50px;">
                The side kick is more advanced, but with practice it can be useful during sparring and a strong kick. It focuses on combining techniques from both the front kick and roundhouse, to deliver a blow that can knock your opponent back and create a good enough space to deliver a second kick.

                Like the two previous kicks, lift your leg up and twist your body. This time, you’ll be pushing forward and kicking with the whole bottom of your foot, focusing with your heel. The best way to practice this kick is to simply hold the kick in place and try to keep your body up.
