                The most important piece of information to know before beginning any form is stances. Your stance can make or break your form and is what keeps it strong. There are three stances used by the first few forms, or Poomsae. 
            </p>
            <p style = "text-indent : 100px;">
                <b>First</b>: Joon Bi - The ready stance. This is less of a stance and more of a beginning position. Simply stand with your feet shoulder width apart, breath in and bring your hands up with your palms facing up, and then breath out as you bring your arms down, place your hands into fists, and then have them opposite each other around your belt level. Now you are ready to begin. 
            </p>    
            <p style = "text-indent : 100px;">
                <b>Second</b>: walking stance. This is the easiest stance, as it has your feet simply at the default walking distance. Take one step forward, and block with the same hand as leg. Make sure to use your other arm kind of like a slide. As you block, pull the second arm to your side. Practice a rhythm of switching feet and the arm you block with. 
            </p>    
            <p style = "text-indent : 100px;">
                <b>Third</b>: Forward stance. From your walking stance, move your front foot between 2 and 3 more steps forward. Your front leg should be bent into a deep stance while your back leg is completely straight. Now, turn your back leg 45 degrees and you’ll be in a deep forward stance. 
            </p>
            <p style = "text-indent : 100px;">
                <b>Fourth</b>: Back stance. From your forward stance, move your front leg back 1 step. Now take almost all the weight off your front leg, supporting yourself 80% on the back leg and 20% on the front. Finally, your back foot should now be a complete 90 degrees. Back stance is used more for the defensive, when moving backwards.
            </p>
            <p style = "text-indent : 100px;">
                Now that you know and have practiced the stances, you are almost ready to begin practicing the first poomsae. There are just a few more things you need to be aware of. Not only do you need to have a good stance when you are doing a form, you also need to be able to block. There are four basic blocks that you should be familiar with. First is the down block, a block that goes just outside of your legs. Second is the high block, this is used to cover your head, and is done by making a 90 degree angle with one of your arms, above your head while still making a bit of space. Having space is important for every block, so when you are hit the block does not impact you, and is instead moved into the space you have. Blocks three and four are opposites of each other, one is an inside-out middle block, and the other is an outside-in middle block. The outside-in middle block comes from your ear, and sits in the middle of your body. The inside-out block is kind of like scooping ice cream, making a half circle with your hand and hitting out. This block lands more on the outside of your body. If any of these descriptions are confusing, feel free to look at the video in order to get a visual of them.
